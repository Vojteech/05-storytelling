Hey, Im Vojtech and i decided to talk about postponing things that you want to do because i recently realized i do that a lot.

But I’d like to start with a story.

Couple of months ago me and my friends had one of those evening when you talk about life and you know…pigeons.
And we were discussing how mail pigeons worked and how humans domesticated this animal and then stopped needing them, stopped using them. And they were left.
And now they are this not super sharp, not super smart bird that doesn’t even really know how to build a nest.

Little did we know that couple weeks later we are going to find a pigeon nest on our balcony.
It started with 3 little sticks and before we had time to realize we had a pigeon nest, a pigeon and a pigeon egg all on your balcony.

The beginnings were hard, we had to get used to each other, but over time we gained his trust and this pigeon really became part of your flat, he became our family, our brother.

So we decided that we want to take a picture of him, because we take a photo on instant camera of everyone that visits our flat. So it was blatantly obvious that this pigeon needs a photo.

We got everything prepared and we were waiting for the perfect time to take THE picture

But then something terrible happened.

We came to our balcony and there was no pigeon, there was just an empty nest with a broken egg. 
It was obvious that a horrible act of violence happened.
But we will never find out what happened and more importantly we will never see our pigeon brother again and we will NEVER take the photo of him.

And it made me realize.
I do this a lot.
I have something that I want to do, but I spend too much time thinking about it and overthinking everything. So I end up never doing that thing because over time I lose interest or something different gets in the way.

And Im not trying to give you a motivation speech right now, trust me there is nothing I would hate more. 
I just think that this is something that happens to a lot of people, which is kinda sad.

And I think it really fits this group of people, because we are all artists and people working in the creative industry, so we should create things. We should create stuff that we love and when we have an idea we should make that idea happen. And even if the result is not perfect it is better then if we did nothing and we just had a full drawer of ideas.

Im not saying that planning is bad or that we should do stuff without properly thinking about it.
Im just saying that I often wait too long and I end up not doing the thing that I would actually really like to do.

So I would like to encourage you to not wait too long and to make your ideas real.

Because if you wait too long 
you might miss your pigeon.
